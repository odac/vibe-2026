# Huat Huat - Lucky Colour Recommendation

## Overview

A simple web application that recommends a lucky colour to the user based on their horoscope. The application will feature a user-friendly interface for selecting a horoscope and will display the recommendation along with a short explanation.

## Project Structure

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web application.
- **`style.css`**: The CSS file for styling the application.
- **`main.js`**: The JavaScript file containing the application logic.
- **`blueprint.md`**: This file, outlining the project plan.

## Plan

1.  **Create the basic HTML structure (`index.html`)**:
    *   Set the title to "Huat Huat".
    *   Add a header with the application title.
    *   Create a dropdown menu for horoscope selection.
    *   Create a container to display the results.
2.  **Style the application (`style.css`)**:
    *   Apply basic styling to the elements.
    *   Use a color scheme that is visually appealing and related to the theme of luck and horoscopes.
3.  **Implement the application logic (`main.js`)**:
    *   Get the user's horoscope selection.
    *   **Simulate fetching lucky color and explanation from an external source using pre-defined data within `main.js`.**
    *   Display the recommendation to the user.
